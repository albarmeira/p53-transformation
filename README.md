# **Single-Cell Multi-Omic Analysis of _TP53_-mutant leukemic transformation**

This repository contains per-figure scripts to regenerate the data presented in Rodriguez-Meira, Norfo, Wen, Chedeville _et al_, 2023.

In addition to per-figure scripts, we also provide the scripts for data preprocessing in the Preprocessing folder.

The single-cell multi-omic dataset was generated using the TARGET-seq protocol (Rodriguez-Meira _et al_, 2019; Rodriguez-Meira _et al_, 2020) and analyzed using the SingCellaR framework (https://github.com/supatt-lab/SingCellaR) for most of the figures.

Source data is available in raw and processed format in: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE226340.

Any queries related to the dataset or the scripts should be directed to:
