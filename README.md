This repository contains per-figure scripts to regenerate the data presented in Rodriguez-Meira, Norfo, Wen, Chedeville et al, Nature Genetics 2023.

The single-cell multi-omic dataset was generated using the TARGET-seq protocol (Rodriguez-Meira et al, 2019; Rodriguez-Meira et al, 2020) and analyzed using the SingCellaR framework (https://github.com/supatt-lab/SingCellaR) for most of the figures.

Source data is available in raw and processed format in: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE226340.
