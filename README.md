# **Single-Cell Multi-Omic Analysis of _TP53_-mutant leukemic transformation**

This repository contains pre-processing and per-figure scripts to regenerate the data presented in Rodriguez-Meira, Norfo, Wen, Chedeville _et al_, Nature Genetics, 2023.

The single-cell multi-omic dataset was generated using the TARGET-seq protocol (Rodriguez-Meira _et al_, 2019; Rodriguez-Meira _et al_, 2020) and analyzed using the SingCellaR framework (https://github.com/supatt-lab/SingCellaR) for most of the figures.

Source data is available in raw and processed format in: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE226340 and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA930152 

Instructions on how to reproduce the single-cell RNA-seq data preprocessing steps are in the folder Preprocessing/. Data for the preprocessing step is available at: https://zenodo.org/record/8038152

Scripts to reproduce each figure are labelled with the corresponding figure number. Source data to reproduce the main figures is available at: https://zenodo.org/record/8060602.
Additionally, raw SNP-Array data corresponding to Fig.1 and Extended Data Fig.1 is available at: https://zenodo.org/record/8073857
